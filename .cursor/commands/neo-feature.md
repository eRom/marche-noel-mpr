description: Initialize a new feature branch named feature/[feature-name]-[YYYY-MM-DD] and set up for development
---

# Instructions
1. **Create a Git branch** following this naming convention:
   - Format: `feature/[feature-name]-[YYYY-MM-DD]`
   - Use kebab-case for the feature name
   - Use today's date in ISO format
   - Example: `feature/user-authentication-2025-10-18`

2. **Analyze the existing codebase** to understand:
   - Current architecture and patterns (`AGENT.md`)
   - Relevant files and modules that will be affected
   - Dependencies and potential conflicts
   - Existing similar implementations or related features

3. **Understand the feature** to implement
[feature-need]

4. **Think deeply and create a comprehensive implementation plan** that includes:
   - **Scope & Requirements**: Clear definition of what needs to be built
   - **Technical Approach**: Architecture decisions and design patterns to follow
   - **File Structure**: List of files to create, modify, or delete
   - **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Ordered list of implementation tasks
   - **Dependencies**: External libraries or internal modules needed
   - **Potential Challenges**: Edge cases, technical debt, or risks to consider
   - **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, and test cases to cover
   - **Performance Considerations**: Any optimization or scalability concerns
   - **SEO Impact**: 
     - Meta tags (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
     - Semantic HTML structure and heading hierarchy
     - URL structure and routing implications
     - Schema.org structured data where applicable
     - Image alt texts and optimization
     - Content discoverability and indexing considerations
   - **Accessibility (A11y) Requirements**:
     - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checklist
     - Keyboard navigation support
     - Screen reader compatibility (ARIA labels, roles, live regions)
     - Focus management and visual indicators
     - Color contrast ratios and visual accessibility
     - Alternative text for non-text content
     - Semantic HTML elements (buttons, links, headings, landmarks)
     - Form labels and error handling accessibility
   - **Rollback Plan**: How to safely revert changes if needed

5. **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear or ambiguous about:
   - Feature requirements or expected behavior
   - Technical constraints or preferences
   - Integration points with existing code
   - Priority or timeline considerations
   - User experience or UI/UX expectations

6. **Wait for confirmation** before starting implementation to ensure alignment on the approach.
